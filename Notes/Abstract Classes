ABSTRACT CLASS

When we have a VIRTUAL function in the class that is set = 0 (called PURE VIRTUAL), that class is ABSTRACT meaning none of it's functionality is implemented.

class Animal {
public:
  virtual void makeNoise() = 0;
  void eat();
}

We cannot INSTANTIATE an Abstract class.

Animal a; // Will not work!

But we can have an Animal Pointer.

Animal *aptr;// WORKS!

Compiler requires all classes inheriting Animal to implement that PURE VIRTUAL function. Otherwise, they become Abstract.

CONCRETE CLASS

When a class has no VIRTUAL function and therefore can be instantiated, it is called CONCRETE.
